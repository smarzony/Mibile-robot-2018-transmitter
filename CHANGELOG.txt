Changelog:

18.11.06
	Radio module is powered directly from 10 V power rail.
	Message length is shortened to 6 bytes
	Receiver skips about 20% of data, but communication is quite stable
	
18.11.07
	Radio module worked like shit before changing channel - need auto channel change: check data loss rate and if its over 20% send message to pilot about changing channel.
	Analog calibration still in progress
	Pretty good data loss rate - almost 0 %
	
19.06.11
	I probably wrote this log as it is a receiver.
	Radio communication works well, but not flawless. Remote controller got new functions, buttons and wider communication gate. In future I plan to add two more potentiometers and I2C screen for 
	receiving data back from robot.
