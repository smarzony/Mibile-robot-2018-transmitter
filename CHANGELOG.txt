Mobile Robot Remote Controller

Changelog:
	
19.06.11
	Radio communication works well, but not flawless. Remote controller got new functions, buttons and wider communication gate. In 	future I plan to add two more potentiometers and I2C screen for	receiving data back from robot.
	
19.06.13
	Tasks were separated with timers, but buttons and encoder got its own handlers, because it works better that way.
